## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (version x.x.x)

    ```
3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage
1. Start the main Flask application:
    ```bash
    python app_main.py

3. Visit http://localhost:5000 in your web browser.

### Configuration

#### Azure AD Configuration
Create an Azure AD application and obtain the client ID and client secret.
Update the client_secrets.json file with your Azure AD credentials.

#### Microservice Configuration
Make sure to replace 'your_secret_key' and 'your_api_key' in config.py with your actual secret and API key values. Additionally, ensure that the configuration values match your actual setup, including the URL for the image processing microservice.

#### imgproxy Configuration
Configure imgproxy by updating the imgproxy.config file with your settings.

#### Docker
1. For the main Flask application:

    ```bash
    docker build -t your_main_app_image -f Dockerfile_main .
    ```

2. For the image processing microservice:

    ```bash
    docker build -t your_image_processing_image -f Dockerfile_image_processing .

    ```
3. Replace your_main_app_image and your_image_processing_image with the desired names for your Docker images.

4. Run the Docker containers:
    - For the main Flask application:

    ```bash
    docker run -p 5000:5000 your_main_app_image
    ```

    - For the image processing microservice:

    ```bash
    docker run -p 5001:5001 your_image_processing_image
    ```

### Test
To run unit tests, use the following command:

    ``bash
    python -m unittest test_app.py
    ```
